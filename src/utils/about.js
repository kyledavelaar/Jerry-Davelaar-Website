  "Therapy is a lot about relationships.  The patient needs to be heard and understood.  The patient's relationship with the therapist needs to be a good fit.  Therapy is also about the patient's relationship to himself/herself.  Sometimes patients are aware of parts of themselves that frustrate them.  Therapy can help them learn to relate to themselves much better when they know how to manage “that part” of themselves, versus “that part” managing them.  Therapy is also about the problem of loneliness; how to be loved and how to love.  Relationships are vital to who we are as human beings made by God.  Even the relationship with God is so important to understand.",
  "Therapy is in part an exploration and openness to discover root issues.  The root issues being the underlying “stuff” that is often subconsciously functioning, which then plays out in our daily lives.  Most of the time patients see the patterns repeating themselves in their life, but are at a loss as to what to do about them.  Often they have tried relentlessly to change others, or keep finding new others, only to realize that in relationships they are also part of the problem.  How they respond to their significant others is something they can learn to change.  And if they change, the relationship will change.",
  "Some patients enter therapy to work out how to handle circumstances that have just surfaced in their life.  Then, when they have worked that out, they terminate therapy.  Others come to therapy unsure specifically what they want to work on.  They just know their life isn't working very well, and they’re aware that it hasn't been well for some time.",
  "It's important that patients understand that therapy is for them.  The patient decides what he or she wants to work on. They decide if they want short term or longer term therapy.  Therapy is about the patient's needs."
